v1.12
    - mailsend was not adding Date header. Some SMTP servers does not add it
    either. Now by default it'll add the Date header (make sure your clock

    flag +D. Thanks to Mr S J Hannan for the bug report.

    - The flag -m is back. This option can be used to attach a text or html
    file as a blody (inline). Example: -m "file.html,text/html". It is the
    caller's responsibily to make sure file type is correct. mailsend will
    not verify if the file is binary or text.

v 1.10
   - If the attachment type was text/plain, <CR><LF> was not added after
     Content-Disposition line which caused attachment to be ignored by
    some mail readers. 
    Thanks to Andrés Ghigliazza for pointing it out.
    (Apr-02-2006)

    - added a new flag -cs to specify the character set for text/plain
    attachment. The default is us-ascii. But if you need some other
    type e.g. "ISO-8859-1", you can use this flag.

    - new flags +b, +c

    - when stdin is greater than BUFSIZ such that a "." is encountered in 
    the middle of a line at just the right point there was a bug that
